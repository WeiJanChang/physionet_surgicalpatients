/* Research Questions
1. Is there a significant association between 
in-hospital mortality (death_inhosp) and preoperative conditions 
such as hypertension (preop_htn), diabetes (preop_dm), or emergency operation status (emop)?
Chi-square test */



/* 2. How do demographic factors such as sex (sex) and ASA physical status classification (asa) affect 
in-hospital mortality (death_inhosp)?
Chi-square test */



/* 3. What is the relationship between the duration of ICU stay  and factors 
such as ASA physical status classification, age, gender, anaesthesia time, and surgery time?
Linear regression */



/* 4. Is there a significant association between the total duration of surgery and in-hospital mortality?
Linear regression or logistic regression */



/* 5. Is there a relationship between the total anesthesia time and postoperative outcomes 
such as ICU stay duration (icu_days) and in-hospital mortality (death_inhosp)?
Linear regression for ICU stay duration and logistic regression for in-hospital mortality */
